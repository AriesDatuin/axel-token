Covers of popular songs. Music with personalized lyrics she's written herself. Even her quirky music videos. All that has attracted hundreds of thousands of YouTube subscribers.<br><br>But all those people listening to her music aren't enough to pay her rent.

Using an AXEL link instead of one for iTunes would instantly boost her earnings by a huge margin with a few moments work. No more paying a fortune to the middleman - fans will finally be able to support her without jumping through hoops.
