		<p>
		He loves taking pictures. His friends tell him he should sell them and do this for a living. But he doesn't want to do it full-time, and trying to do it on the side is hard.<br><br>

		In today's world, his only realistic chance of doing that is by going to a photo licensing site and asking them to sell it for him. The process is incredibly complicated and he has no idea how to begin. And even if he goes through all that and his pictures get sold, who do you think gets most of the money from that sale?<br><br>

		Not Josh.<br><br>

		With the AXEL Marketplace, everything changes. Josh can take a cat picture on his phone. He can then select that picture, set a price, give it some tags like "cat lounging on a stone wall," and hit submit.<br><br> 

		All of a sudden, his picture is up and for sale on the Marketplace. Anyone searching for cat photos can find his work and buy it on the spot.<br><br>

		For Josh and people like him, entirely new career paths become viable.
