		<p>
		Gaming is the biggest entertainment industry and Tina likes to game. She also likes to entertain. As a gaming pro with legions of fans, she's building a loyal following through streaming her content by some of the biggest video sites in the world.<br><br> 

		She's doing well, but is frustrated by constant changes in terms, percentages, ad networks, streaming cuts, and restrictions. Some take over 40% of her revenue simply for hosting her content.<br><br>

		Her loyal fan base wants more content and direct access. They're willing to pay for it, but the platforms aren't on her side.<br><br> 

		Using AXEL's patented digital content and streaming technology, she can stream her content directly to her fans â€“ they're not penalized with fees and forced to watch ads, and she's not hit by large percentage takes. She decides on her content, she decides its value, and she gives access to whoever she wants.<br><br> 

		Not only does she get to stream what she wants for a price she wants, but she doesn't have to use other platforms to provide other cool and exciting content. She can sell apps, digital merchandise, or anything else her fans find of value.<br><br> 

		Tina is now in control over her content, her fan base, and her own business.
